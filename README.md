After downloading a React.js project from GitHub, you typically need to follow these steps to set it up and run it locally:

1. **Navigate to Project Directory**:
   Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the directory where you downloaded the React.js project.

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Run the following command to install the project dependencies using npm (Node Package Manager):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Development Server**:
   Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server by running:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
